Within this directory are contained two directories of interest. The distributed-matmult directory contains the Vanilla Rust implementation of the distributed matrix multiplication, and the hydro_matmult contains the Hydro implementation. The code for the distributed-matmult is found in distributed-matmult/broker/src/main.rs and distributed-matmult/worker/src/main.rs which contain the code for the broker and worker, respectively. Each also contains a DOckerfile for running the files, and distributed-matmult contains a docker-compose for running them as a locally networked system. The files of interest in the hydro_matmult are hydro_matmult/src/cluster_matmult.rs and hydro_matmult/example/cluster_matmult.rs. The one in the src file is the actual implentation, and the one in the example is the local deployment script. The project requires the deployment script be in the examples directory. 

The other directories, async_matmult and sync-matmult, represent steps in the development process towards the Vanilla Rust distributed version. The distributed_matmult.rs and sync_matmult.rs pairs in the hydro_matmult src and example directories aslo represent steps in the development of the Hydro version. All other files represent items that come with the standard Hydro project and Cargo project templates.

The manual to run the distributed matrix multiplcation applications is located in manual.md.
